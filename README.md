The Random Forest regressor model was trained through supervised learning using labelled data. 
Along with labelled data, hyperparameter training was done to ensure that the predictions were as accurate as possible, while keeping the code simple and short.
Another Random Forest Regressor was created with the best paramters and trained.
User input was taken regarding the user's preference about their house, and the model used this data to predict the price of that particular house.
